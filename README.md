## General Knowledge about Arduino
+ Arduino is a company, open source hardware manufactured by an Italian Company to test circuits before implementing them on hardware
+ Arduino IDE _(written in Java and CLI in GO)_ is used for coding [Download Here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
+ C or C++ code using Arduino API _(inspired by Processing Language and Wiring Libraries)_
+ Arduino Program Structure _(aka **Sketch**)_
	```c++
	void setup(){
		// called when a sketch starts, used to initialise variables and hardware components, setup communication, I/O modes for digital pins
		// runs only once after each power up or reset of the Arduino board
	}
	```
	
	```c++
	void loop(){
		// allows program to change and respond, actively controls Arduino board
	}
	```
